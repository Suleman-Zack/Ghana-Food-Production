# Ghana-Food-Production
# Background
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) underscores the global commitment to achieving zero hunger, emphasizing the need for improved and sustainable food systems worldwide. In alignment with this overarching objective, this report focuses on a detailed analysis of food production in Ghana from 1993 to 2017.

# OBJECTIVES
The study aims to
* provide a comprehensive understanding of regional food production, emphasizing annual yields across various regions.
* harness the power of emerging technologies, specifically data analytics, to support policymakers in the judicious allocation of resources.

By leveraging data-driven insights, this initiative aims to enhance and sustain food production in Ghana.

# CONCLUSION
This analysis forms the basis for an in-depth analyses into the factors affecting the production of food in the various regions. Consequently, the next stage of this project is to analyse the various factors and leverage on machine learning to develop a prediction model to forecast the annual food production in the various districts, regions and the country as a whole.
